                DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION) Extended
                  draft-ubbink-zoneversion-extended-00

Abstract

   The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION) extended is a way to get
   information about the version of a DNS in the backend.  For example
   when a DNSSEC signer for a zone generates a new SOA serial, because
   it has created new RRSIG records, the original data has not changed,
   but this is not visible to anyone looking at the zone.  This document
   will make it possible show the zone information which is the base of
   the presented data.

2.  Introduction

   The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION [RFC9660]) extended is a way to get
   information about the version of a DNS in the backend.  For example
   when a DNSSEC signer for a zone generates a new SOA serial, because
   it has created new RRSIG records, the original data has not changed,
   but this is not visible to anyone looking at the zone.  This document
   will make it possible show the zone information which is the base of
   the presented data.

3.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Relation to the ZONEVERSION option

   This document extends the original DNS Zone version Option
   [!@RFC9660] to include an extra ZONEVERSION type.

5.  The backend serial in the zone

   To make the backend serial available in the ZONEVERSION, it must be
   available in the zone itself.  Because creating an out of bound
   solution would be to much work.  This document defines a label where
   the backend serial will be available to be used in the ZONEVERSION.

   The backend serial will be published in a _version label under the
   zone apex.

   For example:

   _version.example.nl IN TXT "2025101099"

   There MUST only be one _version label. (??? TODO what would happen if
   there are multiple???)

6.  The backend serial ZONEVERSION type

   This document defines a new ZONEVERSION option TYPE, which can be
   constructed from a label in the zone.

   The mnemonic for this type is "BACKEND-SERIAL".

   The VERSION value for the BACKEND-SERIAL type MUST be a copy of the
   _version label in the zone.

7.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   TODO

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions

9.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to original authors of [RFC9660](the ZONEVERSION
   document).
